# RollBattle 🎲

My first web game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **jQuery**.  
It’s a fun two-player dice game — refresh the page to roll the dice and see who wins!

## 🧠 About the Project
RollBattle is a beginner-friendly web game I created while learning DOM manipulation and interactivity with **jQuery**.  
It simulates two players rolling dice — each refresh triggers a new roll, and the game automatically declares the winner.

## ⚙️ Features
- Two-player dice roll game  
- Randomized outcomes using JavaScript logic  
- Dynamic DOM updates with jQuery  
- Fully responsive layout (Bootstrap)

## 🛠️ Built With

## 💻 How It Works
When the user refreshes the page:
1. Two random numbers between 1–6 are generated.
2. Each number corresponds to a dice image.
3. The script updates both player dice images.
4. The winner is displayed based on who rolled higher.
